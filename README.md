# Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning
### Scope
The problem of processing datasets such as electronic medical records(EMR)  and their integration with genomics, environmental factors, socioeconomic factor and patient behavior variations have posed a problem for researchers the health industry. Due to rapid innovations in machine learning field such as big data,  analytics,visualization, deep learning, health workers now have improved way of processing, and developing meaningful information from huge datasets that have been accumulated over many years . 
Big data and machine learning can benefit public health researchers with analyzing thousands of variables to obtain data regarding life expectancy. We can use demographics of selected regional areas and multiple behavioral health disorders across regions to find correlation between individual behavior indicators and behavioral health outcomes.
